It's Emre. In short, he is a geek, a computer enthusiast. My philosophy is that a computer isn't smart without operators that write codes and uses the hardware of a computer such as mine, hence it requires a geek to get to control over it. So my mission is to define the problem I want to solve and then write the software that turns those ideas into reality. My vision is to learn to code advanced to build complex algorithm solves problem as a member of a computer-related project. Currently focusing on backend development.
